## 9. Problems and Solutions
- **Issue:** ESP overloaded with tasks, hardware limits  
  **Solution:** Removed ESP, replaced with PC-to-PC **TCP communication**  
- **Issue:** HTTP caused delays  
  **Solution:** Used **serial communication** (Arduino‚ÜîPC) and **TCP** (PC‚ÜîPC) for real-time performance  
- **Issue:** Arduino Uno couldn‚Äôt handle all sensors + comms  
  **Solution:** Split roles: **Arduino Mega = sensors, Arduino Uno = motors**

## 10. Limitations
1. More precise alcohol detection & anti-tampering needed  
2. Additional GPS, speed, and acceleration sensors for enriched data  
3. Security for servers managing driver personal data  
4. More driving habit data needed for analysis  
5. Improve motor response to ultrasonic data in real-time  
6. Replace low-quality sensors with higher-grade sensors
